# Vim Files

My Vim setup

## Setup

Upgrade vim using Homebrew. Most default Vim installs are not compiled with +clipboard or +ruby. +clipboard is a must for me and +ruby is required for Command-T

`brew install hg` 

`brew install https://raw.github.com/AndrewVos/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb`

Get the repo

`git clone git://github.com/james-maloney/vim_files.git ~/vim_files`

`cd ~/vim_files`

`/.setup.sh`

### Good to know

- `Esc` is mapped to `jk`
- The `<leader>` key is mappked to `,`
- `,t` is the shortcut for Commant-T
- `,l` toggles invisible characters
